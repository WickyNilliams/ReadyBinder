with readyBinder you can have one document ready handler which will never need to be changed (unless you want to reconfigure),and only the code you need to execute is executed.

everything is wired up declaratively, by specifying the names of functions to execute on any attribute on any element.

this means you no longer need server-side logic to spit out a relevant ready handler per page - your handler is now a write-once affair
